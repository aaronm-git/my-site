                            Junior frontend developer looking for a place in the online tech industry. I recently graduated Ironhack, where I learned full-stack web development
                            (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular2, Node.js) and perfected my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I am very comfortable translating PSD files to HTML5,
                            sticking to the design as closely as possible while keeping in mind responsive design, SEO, and the overall user experience.
